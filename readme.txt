This simple plugin allows you include a seperate stylesheet and/or javascript file for any page on your site.

== Description ==

A very simple plugin that checks for CSS and javascript files matching the name of the current page and automatically includes the necessary markup in the <head> to include them in the page.

== Installation ==

1. Download page-specific-cssjs.<version>.zip
2. Unzip the archive
3. Upload the page-specific-cssjs folder to your wp-content/plugins directory
4. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin interface
5. To include a CSS and/or javascript file in a page, simply give it the same name as the page and drop it in your theme folder

For example, if you wanted a new stylesheet for the page at http://www.mydomain.com/about/ you would create a file called about.css in /wp-content/themes/yourtheme/.

Enjoy!
